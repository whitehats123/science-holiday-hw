<B>HOW ARE MASKS AND PPE KITS MADE ?  <B><BR><BR>DURING COVID – 19 TIMES , THE DEMAND FOR FACE SHEILDS AND PPE KITS HAS INCREASINGLY GROWN , BUT HAVE YOU EVER WONDERED HOW THESE SAFETY EQUIPMENT ARE MADE ? <BR><BR>
For each type of PPE, there are different raw materials and manufacturing processes.PPE kits are generally made up of plastic . 
Protective gowns are generally made with spunbond or meltblown nonwovens produced via thermal, chemical, or mechanical bonding. The raw material for this cloth is synthetic, typically polypropylene, polyester, polyethylene, or something similar. Varying the fiber type, bonding process, and fabric finish can change the properties of the material for specific uses. Sometimes these gowns combine nonwovens with plastic film or other materials that provide greater protection from liquids. Reusable gowns can be made from 100% cotton or polyester, as well as cotton/polyester blends. The fabric is tightly woven and then sometimes pressed to improve its liquid resistance.

N95 Respirators, a specialized type of mask with higher filtration abilities, are one of the more complicated types of PPE to manufacture. Respirators are made with meltblown nonwoven fabric, which is produced by polypropylene fibers.
Face shields are simple PPE that consist of a visor, a lightweight plastic or metal frame, and a suspension system that attaches the shield to the wearer’s head.Visors can be made up of plastics such as polycarbonate, propionate, ac-etate, polyvinyl chloride, and polyethylene terephthalate glycol (also known as PETG).
Goggles usually start with an injection molded lens made from high purity polycarbonate, one of the more impact- and scratch-resistant plastics.<BR><BR><B>WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY ARE DISPOSED IN BINS ? <B><BR><BR>PPE is not bio degradable thus when it is disposed in bins and deposited in landfills , it does not degrade or mix with the soil . thus it then results in pollution .<BR><BR><B>WAYS AND GUIDLINES TO TAKE CARE OF THIS NEW NORMAL DEMAND <B><BR><BR>Italy has introduced extra safe procedures for its PPE. Waste is sealed in multiple containers, stored away from others in the hospital and moved via dedicated corridors and elevators.

In China, where at the peak of the virus hospitals in Wuhan were generating up to six times more waste than normal, a new medical waste plant and 46 mobile treatment facilities were constructed to deal with the excess.
As well as destroying viruses, incineration can reduce the amount of waste left over in general. Heat produced by municipal energy from waste incinerators can also be used as a source of energy, either to heat local buildings or to produce electricity.
Other ways that we can disposed of ppe kits is to sterilize them with uv kits and reuse them .<BR><BR><B>WAYS BASED ON PREWORK <B>REDUCE : REDUCE THE NUMBER OF PPE KITS USED UNLESS ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY<BR><BR> 
REPURPOSE : STERILIZE AND REPURPOSE PPE KITS TO MAKE SOMTHING ELSE . <BR><BR>
RETHINK : RETHINK THE NUMBER AND HOW WE ARE USING THE PPE KITS<BR><BR>
REFUSE : TO LET PPE CONTRIBUTE TO POLLUTION
